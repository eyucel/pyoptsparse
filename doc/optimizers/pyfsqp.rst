FSQP
----
This code implements an SQP approach that is modified to generate
feasible iterates. In addition to handling general single objective
constrained nonlinear optimization problems, the code is also capable
of handling multiple competing linear and nonlinear objective
functions (minimax), linear and nonlinear inequality constraints, as
well as linear and nonlinear equality constraints
